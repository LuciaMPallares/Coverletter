# Coverletter

My name is Lucía and I am Data analyst but I start to work when i was 18 years old and i was a student. I have worked in several jobs such as waitress, congress woman, event planner and so on... The last 13 years I had worked in sales and digital marketing in APERTURA, a photography school and gallery. As a result of all that experience, I became a resolutive, organized and positive professional with spirit of self-improvement. 
In my last job my tasks changed over the years. At the beginning, my main duties were sales. Due to this fact, I passed information about the courses to the people that came to the school and answered email or phone calls. Until this moment, the only main sales channel was by word of mouth, so I propose the idea to start using new technologies to bring new students by improving social media, newsletters, digital marketing… and its worked beautifully. The number of students increased year by year, and they came from farther places each time.  Because of that I started to have new tasks which increased along the years. My interest in continuous learning and self-improvement made me be the Marketing Analyst and responsible of the communications department, also for social media, newsletter and advertisement. Over all I leaded the supervision and measurement of KPIs. Among the tools that I used were Excel, google analytic, SEO tools... but I needed more. 

I just finished a data analytics bootcamp by Ironhack. Now I feel comfortable working with Python, and several libraries like Pandas, Numpy, matplot or seaborn. Also I have experience with SQL, and visualization tools as Power BI or Tableau. Those abilities make me able to find solutions, and help companies with their problems.

I am willing to face challenges as data analyst. I can offer you data driven insights and solutions, as well as I have a nice mindset related to problem solving, resilience and adaptation.

About work location, I live in Malaga so I have no problem with remote positions if were necessary, or visit de office each moth in other city.
